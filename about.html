    <p>I am a visual communication designer with a multidisciplinary approach 
        anchored in storytelling, psychology, and considered aesthetics. 
        I study Design and Visual Communication at the German Jordanian University,
        where I’ve built a foundation in branding, illustration, product thinking, 
        and visual systems. My work moves between structured design and exploratory problem-solving, 
        often leaning into complex ideas but expressing them with clarity. I gravitate toward design 
        that is intentional, thoughtful, and grounded rather than ornamental.
